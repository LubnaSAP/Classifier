Code of how to classify neural data collected from a neuroimaging experiment when the encoding phase is taking place.

Any recent version of Python allowing SVM is going to work for this code.
For the classification I provided the corresponding mask of the brain in the hippocampus. But to be able to run this code you would need a file containing the labels and another one providing the neural data during the enoding phase.

In the file neural_data_processing there are instruction explaining how to prepare the data for the later use of the classifier.
